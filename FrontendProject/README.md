## Art Generator

In this project, I worked together with a group of 2 other developers to implement a User Interface which generates random art for the user by linkage to Chicago Metropolitan Art Museum's Api.

## Making it Work

### Situation
	During the process of making the app, we encountered issues with the API being very unstable. This would result in outputs on the UI that were repetitive or non-existent.
### Task
    Fix the issue in order to have a working product.
### Action
	Work around the unstability and provide defaulted or cached mechanisms for providing user content if the API hits incorrectly.
### Result
	A beautiful working UI that generates random art for the user!

## Competencies
### JF 2.5: Can implement a responsive User Interface
- Together with 2 other developers, delievered a robust user interface in React with 4 or 5 working compontents including filtering, routing, and buttons.

### JF 2.7: Effectively manages state for complex User Interfaces
- I was able to identify a bug of art images not rendering correctly on the UI due to incorrect state management. Context was also used on this app to spread state accross multiple React Components in different layers of the app.
