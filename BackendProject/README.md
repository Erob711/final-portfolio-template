## Inventory App: Refactoring a Node.JS Backend into Java/Springboot
link: https://github.com/Erob711/inventory-app-spring-backend 

In this solo project, I went back to the Inventory App (with a backend written in Javascript), and rewrote the backend in Java.

Built in Java SpringBoot:

### Situation
    My "employer" needed me to swap the Node backend for a Spring application.
### Task
    Go into the old backend which was written in Node.JS/Express, and digest the code. Rework a new set of APIs that can serve the client in the same fashion, but in Spring/Java.
### Action
    Spin up a brand new service in Java. Refactor old code into brand new service.
### Result 
    A new, refactored backend!

## Competencies
### JF 3.6: Can implement a RESTful API
    I had to create new routes/services in a Spring application.

### JF 3.3: Can link code to data sets
    Working with the old data set, I had to stay closely linked to the data needs, and although working with a new language, ensure the same integrity of service on the data.
