## Pokemon UI: Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline Procedures
link: https://github.com/Erob711/pokemon-ui  

Here, I took another old bootcamp project (Pokemon UI), which was built in React, and I deployed it to Netlify with an auto-deploy linked to main branch. I also implemented some automated checks in the CI pipeline.
