## Project #1: Inventory App
link: https://github.com/multiverseCelcTeam/inventory-app 

This is a group project I worked on with 3 other apprentices during the Multiverse Learning Bootcamp. It's designed to be a simple app for employees managing an inventory system.
Built in React and Node.js:

## Competencies
### JF 2.1: Can create and analyze artefacts, such as use cases and/or user stories
We were tasked with making clickable cards representing inventory items at a store (things like jackets or vacuums) that mapped to real changes persisted in a database.

In order to accomplish this, we had to split up front and backend and make sure we had a set model for our data that had continuity throughout the application.

As a result, we were able to include the full functionality of this feature into the app and demonstrate bringing a user story from start to finish!

### JF 6.5: Works collaboratively with a wide range of people in different roles, internally and externally, with a positive attitude to inclusion & diversity

As this was a group project, I was able to work with a group of developers and put multiple brains to work. Doing great things can only happen together!
